## 🎯 Project Objective

Waypoint is a full-stack web application that lets users track their travels across the United States.
Users can create an account, log trips they’ve taken, and view a color-coded U.S. map that highlights the states they’ve visited.

Each user can:

-- Create an account and securely log in/out

-- Edit or delete their account information

-- Add, edit, and delete trips

-- View travel statistics (total states visited, total trip costs, % of U.S. covered)

-- Browse state detail pages with regional info and fun facts

## 🧠 Tech Stack

-- Frontend React (Hooks), Vite, HTML5, CSS3

-- Backend Node.js, Express

-- Database MongoDB (using official driver, no Mongoose)

-- Libraries react-simple-maps (for U.S. map), bcryptjs, Passport

-- Development Tools Prettier (code formatting), ESLint (linting), GitHub, VS Code

## 🧑‍🎨 Design Overview

Theresa focused on user account management and authentication, while Stewart focused on trip management and visualization.
Together, these features create a complete travel-tracking experience.

### Key Features

Edit name or email via /account/edit

Delete account permanently

State info pages with JSON data for all 50 states

#### 🗺️ Trip Dashboard (Stewart)

Add trips with start/end destinations and optional legs

Edit or delete trips

Calculate total cost and states visited

Display interactive map using react-simple-maps

## ⚙️ Local Installation / Setup / Development

### 🧱 Prerequisites

Node.js 22+

MongoDB running locally (mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017)

Create database called `tripTracker`

- Create two collections: `users` and `trips`

### Scripts

Open 2 terminal windows from the root of the project repo and run the following commands in their respective window:

1. Window 1: Backend
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Window 2: React Frontend (Vite):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or optionally the following commands in order:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   Make sure both the backend and frontend are running simultaneously.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a .env file at the project root with:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/tripTracker
PORT=3000
MAPBOX_TOKEN=YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN
```

Create a .env file inside client with:

```
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN
```

## 🧭 Usage Instructions

Visit http://localhost:5174

Register a new user account.

Log in and open your Account Page to edit name or email.

Add trips from your dashboard and view the color-coded map.

Delete account if desired (handled safely with cookie cleanup).

## 🧹 Developer Notes

The project uses Prettier for code formatting.
Run npm run format in the project root to format both client & server.

Cookies are configured for localhost to ensure session persistence.

No Mongoose or Axios were used — only official MongoDB and fetch APIs.

ESLint configuration ensures clean, consistent syntax.

Environment secrets are excluded from source control.

## 🌐 Deployment

The application can be deployed with:

Render

Environment variables should match .env from development.

Start servers.

Visit /register → create an account.

Log in, edit name/email, confirm changes.

Add at least one trip → confirm map highlights visited states.

Refresh page — data should persist.
